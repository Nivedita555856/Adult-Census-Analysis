# Adult-Census-Analysis
This project analyzes the Adult Census dataset to examine how demographic, educational, and occupational factors relate to income levels. Using Excel, the analysis uncovers patterns across age, gender, education, work class, and hours worked per week through pivot tables, charts, and interactive visualizations.
